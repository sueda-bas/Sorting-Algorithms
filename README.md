# Sorting Algorithms Implementation â€“ Bubble Sort & Insertion Sort
This project is a Python-based implementation of **Bubble Sort** and **Insertion Sort** algorithms, designed for educational purposes. The aim is to provide a deeper understanding of how sorting works by displaying each step of the sorting process.

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- **Implements Bubble Sort & Insertion Sort** from scratch.
- **Prints each step of the sorting process** for better visualization.
- **No built-in sorting functions are used**, ensuring a complete manual implementation.
- **Handles empty lists and already sorted lists** with appropriate messages.
- **Command-line input support**, allowing flexible usage.

## ðŸ“‚ Input & Output
- The input list is provided in a text file, with elements separated by spaces.
- The program reads the input file and applies both sorting algorithms.
- **Each step of the sorting process is printed** in a structured format.
- If the list is already sorted, the program outputs: `"Already sorted!"`
- The sorted results are written to separate output files.

## ðŸš€ How to Run
```bash
python3 sort.py input.txt output_bubble.txt output_insertion.txt
